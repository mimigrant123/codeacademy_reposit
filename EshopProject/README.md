There is my eShop project.

The purpose of the project - to make workable web application for selling handmade baskets.

It was built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, featuring sign in/up, admin panel, product listings, shopping cart, and checkout functionality.

To launch my Basket Shop, run the "run.py" file.
